    | You have landed on my personal website.  What brought you here today is likely a bit of a mystery to me,
    | but since you are here, you might as well have a nose around.  Mostly this website is my excuse to mess
    | around with things.  Try my hand at a bit of web design and engineering.

    | From a hobbyist perspective I am quite proud of my little website, since I have written it from “scratch”
    | including the web server that it is running on.  Actually, I have combined together several pieces of
    | technology to bring you this website, including <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a>,
    | <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/" target="_blank">Dojo Toolkit</a>, <a href="http://jade-lang.com/"
    | target="_blank">Jade</a>, <a href="http://expressjs.com">Express</a> and some of my own projects.
