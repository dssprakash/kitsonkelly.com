          | I have a strong background in technology leadership.  Having lead several areas of technology, I
          | understand well how technology needs to support business operations, and without the business context,
          | technology often wanders around in the wilderness.  I strive to ensure that at all levels, technology and
          | the business engage and align to pull in the same direction.  I have significant experience in both
          | supporting business systems and consumer technology.
